## Project Walkthrough

This portfolio demonstrates a structured API testing approach:

1. Designed test plan for User endpoint
2. Created functional and negative test cases
3. Validated database responses using SQL
4. Documented defect report with severity analysis
5. Structured documentation for maintainability

This reflects a real QA workflow from planning → testing → validation → reporting.

## Test Scenarios Summary

The following scenarios were designed to validate API reliability, data integrity, and security:

- Valid request returns correct user data
- Invalid ID returns proper error message
- Unauthorized request is rejected
- Boundary value IDs handled correctly
- SQL injection attempt blocked
- Response time within acceptable threshold
- Invalid HTTP method handled correctly

These scenarios demonstrate structured test design, negative testing, and edge case validation.
